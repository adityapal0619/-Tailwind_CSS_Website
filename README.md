Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for creating fast and efficient user interfaces. Instead of writing custom CSS, you use pre-defined utility classes directly in your HTML to style your elements. It provides great flexibility and is highly customizable.

Key Features of Tailwind CSS:
Utility-First Approach: Focuses on small, single-purpose classes like text-center, p-4, or bg-blue-500 instead of traditional CSS.
Customizability: Fully customizable using the tailwind.config.js file to define your theme, colors, spacing, and more.
Responsive Design: Built-in classes for responsive breakpoints (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) make creating mobile-first designs straightforward.
No CSS Overhead: No unused stylesâ€”Tailwind's purge option removes unused classes in production builds for optimized file sizes.
Component-Based: Simplifies the creation of reusable components without requiring separate CSS files.
